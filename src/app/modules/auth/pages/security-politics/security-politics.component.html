        <p>Information about our users is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling
          our users' personal information to others. Onlyone shares users' personal information only as described below
          and with Onlyone subsidiaries or affiliates that are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at
          least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
          Third-party service providers: We engage other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.
          Examples include analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments, streaming content, and
          assessing and managing credit risk. These third-party service providers have access to personal information
          necessary to perform their functions but may not use it for other purposes. In addition, they must process
          personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and as permitted by applicable data protection
          laws.
          Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase other businesses or
          services. In such transactions, user information is generally one of the transferred businesses assets but
          remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents
          otherwise). In addition, in the unlikely event that Onlyone or substantially all its assets are acquired, user
          information will be one of the transferred assets.
          Protection of Onlyone and Others: We disclose the account and other personal information when we believe
          disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law or our regulatory obligations; enforce or apply our Terms of
          Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Onlyone, our users, or others. This
